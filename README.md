Movie Trailer Website
=====================

## Description
A movie trailer website created using Python. This is the first project submission for the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree.

The site displays thumbnails and titles of movies which, when clicked, play the trailer for the corresponding film.

## Usage
To run the site, make sure Python is installed on your system. You can then download the files, or clone the repository, and run `python entertainment_centre.py` in the terminal.

Open `fresh_tomatoes.html` in your browser to view the generated page.
